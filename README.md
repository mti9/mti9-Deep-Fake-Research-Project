# This project aims to tackle the increasing difficulty of identifying counterfeit multimedia content, particularly DeepFakes, which are artificially created using advanced artificial intelligence methods. The project entails a complete strategy that encompasses completing a systematic literature review to identify existing approaches and problems, gathering and preparing genuine and counterfeit multimedia data, and constructing models capable of detecting fraudulent content. The project's objective is to establish a robust testbed by implementing and evaluating several detection methods. This testbed will serve as a fundamental platform for future study and advancement in the field of multimedia forgery detection. Furthermore, the project aims to document discoveries and approaches in order to improve the scholarly and practical understanding of DeepFake detection.
# You can currently access a dataset containing 800 voice-cloned samples. In addition to these cloned samples, original recordings are also available to facilitate future comparisons and help distinguish between the two.
